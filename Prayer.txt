Prayer

Q. Why are your prayers never answered even though you pray with great faith? 
A.
As our Lord said ‘if you have faith as small as the mustard seed and if you say to this mountain be moved, it shall be moved’ while increasing ones faith in God is good, but one should also seek to deepen ones faith in God. What the difference? 
God has three ways of answering prayers – with a “Yes”, “No” or a “Wait”
If I pray to God for something with faith and I receive it. That’s great faith
If I pray to God for something with faith and do not receive it, and hereby begin to trust that God has something better for me than that which I am asking for. I may not see it, I may not understand it, I may not know it, but I am willing to trust it. That’s a deep faith.
Do not bother about what you receive and not receive, prayers being answered and not being answered because God always hears our prayers, even that which we cannot express in words he understands it,  and he always gives to us that which is good for us at the time which he knows to be best. For E.g. Martha’s brother Lazarus was dead and people told Jesus ‘Lord you’re late, if you were here you could have saved him’ was Jesus really late? He raised Lazarus from the dead at a time he saw best.

Q. Even though im so spiritual, I don't get the gift of tongues. Why? 
A.
Being spiritual is not counted or measured based on what gifts of the Holy Spirit you have, but by the Fruits of the Holy Spirit i.e. Love, Joy, Peace, Patience, Kindness, Gentleness, Holiness, Self-control. It may come surprise you that even some Saints never had the gift of tongues. That is why St Paul writes in the bible I will stop seeing visions, my tongues will stop prophesy, but love will endure until the very end. Being spiritual is measured by the fruits and especially Love and not gifts. Gift of the Holy Spirit will come when they are due. You don’t pluck a fruit from the tree before it is ripe similarly when the Holy Spirit knows you are ready he will bless you with it. Until then Pray.

Q. Our prayers are heard by Jesus first and then to God the Father r Mary our Mother, Jesus and then God the Father. (Who hears our prayers first) 
A.
Our prayers are heard by God. We have one God. The Father, Son & the Holy Spirit are three different persons but one God. Hence even though we may pray to one but it’s known to the other. Mary’s role is that of an intercessor, seeing how she was in the life of Jesus as described in the Gospels.

Q. How many beads does a rosary have? 
A.
1 Our Father (Lord’s Prayer), 3 Hail Mary (Angelic Salutations) to begin and 5 decades to follow. So about 59 beads
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. When and how was the rosary instituted? 
A.
During the early 1200s a Heresy broke out in southern France that split the unity among Catholics. During that time a Holy Priest from Spain (St Dominic Guzman) was sent to preach the true faith to them and bring back these lost sheep. At first St Dominic Guzman tried to preach to them but they didn’t listen and were not willing to change their evil ways & practices. St Dominic tried harder but no success came his way. Finally he began to Pray and ask God for help. The Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to St Dominic Guzman holding a Rosary. He never knew what it was. She taught him to prayer the Rosary and said to him “This prayer will convert many Sinners and bring back many who are lost, prayer it daily”. As he prayed and taught other to pray the Rosary he preached and baptized many. 
St Dominic Guzman is also the founder of the order of Dominicans Priests

Q. What if you don't know exactly to pray and each and every one is giving you different advice on how to read the bible and how to pray and what to pray?? How do you know what is right? Just say a Rosary and your sorted? How does that do justice? 
A.
I always say ‘prayer is nothing but that which comes out of your heart and reaches the heart of God’. There is no specific way of praying and not praying, as long as the voice of your heart is reaching the heart of God, it is prayer. It can even mean a simple dialogue with God just as you would have with a friend. Even silence is a form of prayer. Different people do suggest different methods of prayer according to their perspective. But at the end, it is you who ought to discover and create your own style of prayer. The Rosary is just one form of prayer among many others.
As St Jose Marie Escriva said ‘If you do not know how to pray close your eyes and say God I do not know how to prayer, be sure you have already started’

Q. Why is the church so important if people can pray alone and not show the world they are praying? (Because usually families see people going daily for mass as holy and who doesn't go not holy) ? Is drinking alchol asin actually as I have seen and even heard priest drinking, because I suppose they should be the holiest and be God's messenger 
A.
There is no restriction to be alone in prayer, but the church is of utmost importance. Lone ranger Christianity is not something to be advised. The church is our sustenance in the faith. Sure you can pray alone but for how long will you be able to sustain in your spiritual journey by being alone and what kind of spiritual growth will take place by being alone. Even Jesus when he sent out his apostles to proclaim the Good News he sent them in pairs making sure at no point they should be alone.  
Drinking Alcohol may not be a sin but getting drunk and making a fool of oneself is definitely a form of debauchery. True that a priest is Christ in person (since he serves the people of God in the person of Christ) he should be holy. If you come across any priest doing something you believe to be wrong, don’t judge him, don’t condemn him, you don’t know what he faces. But instead pray for him it’s far more valuable.
