Q. Why are relationships complicated? Friends/ family/ girlfriends/ affairs? 
A.
Relationships appear to be complicated because they involve people with different mindsets, different priorities, different aims and ambitions in life as well as people at different development levels. To make any relationship work it takes time and effort to understand these differing aspects and a willingness to adapt and change to these differences, all the while respecting each other and helping each other grow mentally, emotionally as well as spiritually. One must remember that complications may arise at the level of opinion. Everyone is entitled to an opinion and we must learn to respect opinion. It is beautifully said, “I may not see eye to eye, but that does not mean that I stop walking hand in hand.”
It takes love, respect, commitment and a healthy prayer life to make any relationship work and flourish"

Q. Why do young kids die of diseases? 
A.
"There are many reasons for why young kids die of diseases - not everything is God sent many incidents are man-made
Many respiratory diseases originate from the high levels of pollution caused by human industrial activity (cases of severe bronchitis, asthma etc.)
Many diseases are caused by negligent activities of parents during the mother's pregnancy such as drinking, doing drugs etc.
Some diseases may also result in death of kids because their parents cannot afford to have their children treated and because rich people around them also refuse to help them or because the governments cannot provide adequate healthcare infrastructure
Some deaths may also be allowed by God for special reasons that we may not be able to fathom at the moment of their happening"
