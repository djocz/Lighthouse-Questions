Priests

Q. Why are only men annointed priest? 
A.
Thank you for the question. 

There aren’t many issues within apologetics that require as much sensitivity as this one. In a culture where opening the door for a woman can be seen as an act of misogyny, it’s no surprise that male-only ordination strikes some as sexist on the Church’s behalf.

It can’t be denied that there are women who could be more moving orators than some priests and provide more consolation within the confessional. But the debate over ordination is not over who could be a better priest but over who could be a priest at all.

So, if a woman’s abilities are not in question, what’s keeping the Church from ordaining her? For one, it should be noted that Jesus did not ordain any women. He selected all of his apostles, and none were women.

Some say that he was bound by the cultural norms of his era to suppress the roles of women, but no one has been able to prove that this was his motive. Furthermore, this accuses Jesus of sexism and it paints an inaccurate portrait of Christ, who had no qualms about shattering the cultural norms regarding interaction with women (Matt. 9:20; Luke 7:37; John 4:27). The idea of priestesses was not unknown to him, since it was a common practice in religions of his time and culture, though not Judaism. (If Jesus had wanted women as priestesses, he would have had the ideal candidate in Mary. Here was a woman who could have spoken the words of consecration literally: "This is my body. This is my blood.")

There were other roles that Christ had in mind for women. For example, they played a key role in the spread of the Gospel, being the first to spread the news of the risen Christ. They were also allowed to pray and prophecy in church (1 Cor. 11:1–16), but they were not to assume the function of teaching in the Christian assembly (1Cor. 14:34–38; 1 Tim. 2:1–14), which was restricted to the clergy.

Two thousand years later, no one—including the pope—has the authority to change the designs of the Church that Christ instituted. Specifically, the Church is unable to change the substance of a sacrament. For example, a person cannot be baptized in wine, nor may a substance other than bread be used for the consecration at Mass. If invalid matter is used, then the sacrament does not take place. Likewise, since the priest acts in the person of Christ, the Church has no authority to confer the sacrament on those who are unable to represent the male Jesus Christ.

Also, equality between the sexes doesn't mean sameness. It's the fundamental difference of the sexes that reveals the great "spousal mystery". It's the fundamental difference of the sexes that quite literally brings life to the world.

Men and women have different callings in this life-giving communion. It's the bridegroom who gives the seed and the bride who conceives life within her. One role isn't better than the other. Both are equally dignified and indispensable. We must receive the calling we've been given as a gift from God if we are ever to be at peace with ourselves. Should men complain that God hasn't given them the privilege of being mothers?

For a woman to want to be an ordained priest is similarly misguided. We call priests father for a reason. Priests efficaciously symbolize Christ's giving up his body for his Bride so that she can conceive life "in the Holy Spirit". Only men can do this. As John Paul II reminded us: "It is the Eucharist that above all expresses the redemptive act of Christ the Bridegroom towards the Church, the Bride. This is clear and unambiguous when the sacramental ministry of the Eucharist, in which the priest acts `in the person of Christ', is performed by a man."' If the ministry of the Eucharist were performed by a woman, the symbolism would become that of bride to bride. There would be no possibility of effecting spousal union and thus no possibility of new life coming to the Church. Here we see again how intimately united the marital embrace is with the Eucharist. John Paul II summed it up this way: "The Eucharist is . . . the sacrament of the Bridegroom and of the Bride."'

Q. WHY THE WHOLE-WOMEN PRIEST INITIATIVE WAS SCRAPPED BY THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH. How can we say that Catholics treat every one equally, with love and respect if there is a degree of subordination of women. During the olden days not having women priest was acceptable because of the societal pressure and expectations. HOWEVER NOW WHY ARE WE STILL HOLDING ON OR LITERALLY STICKING TO THE PAST WHEN IT COMES TO CULTURE AND NORMS however using modern technology such as social media to spread the Word of God?

Q. Why do priests cause so much issues during weddings and funerals? Such sticky priests are the reason people leave the church. 
A.
DIFFICULT TO ANSWER THIS BECAUSE THE ISSUES ARE NOT KNOWN… I HAVE HAD AND SEEN HOW PEOPLE THEMSELVES BEHAVE WHEN IT COMES TO WEDDINGS AND FUNERALS….THE DEMANDS THAT THEY MAKE ON THE CONDUCT OF BOTH AND IF THE PARTIES ARE SHOWN THE RULE BOOK THEY START FINDING FAULT WITH THE PRIESTS. IT WOULD BE NICE TO KNOW WHAT ARE THE ISSUES!

Q. Why are nuns given less preference than priests 
A.
In the first place it would be nice to understand about the context of preference – does it have to be with regard to church roles or in the matter of lifestyle?
Very often, it is heard that priests are very lucky! They get a chance to travel to any part of the world. They are allowed to do what they like. Nuns always have restrictions.
Actually this observation stems from the general one where the social set up sees the boys enjoying life more than the girls do. The priesthood is as multi-faceted as the life of the nun is. It all depends on the congregation and the attitude of the nuns. There are many nuns holding responsible posts as principals, administrators and so on. Also, if you look at the geographical setting of the congregation then you will realize that the nuns travel even more than priests do. 

So its all a matter of perspective!

Q. So that next holy thing next to God is priests. But I had a recent encounter with a priest where I feel he was wrong and though being wrong I went to apologize him and waited for three hrs outside his office. This year being the year of forgiveness, still he didn't let me in the office and made me wait. So my question is, a priest being a human after all, why do we need to confess to him??? Coz he's just a human 
A.
In the first place, holiness is not the prerogative only of priests. Every human person is holy, considering that we are all created in the image and likeness of God who is holy. 
It was nice of you to take the initiative to apologise. Unfortunately the circumstances may have not helped the reconciliation. Yes, priests are human and sometimes they do find themselves in situations which others may not be able to understand.
One is not sure if the priest had genuine reason not to see you in the three hours. Maybe there was a situation he was dealing with that required his time and attention. Maybe he did deliberately make you wait that long. If it is true then it means that he allowed his weak human nature to get the better of him. This does not justify his reasons. But I feel it is better to focus on the fact that at least you took the first step to apologise.
About the Sacrament of Reconciliation it is a fact that God’s grace flows through human instruments and priests are given the grace to absolve us of our sins. Of course it becomes difficult to understand how a priest with all his humanity and weaknesses can still be used by God as a channel of His grace. A mystic once correctly remarked that “even clean water can run through rusty pipes.” That is the power of God’s grace that is manifest in the priest, no matter how weak he maybe.
