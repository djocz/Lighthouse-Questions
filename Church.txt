Q. In this time if a man says he is a prophet and also thinks he has proofs, how is someone going to believe? Will the same crucifixion repeat since no one would believe him? 
A.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A prophet as understood scripturally is one who speaks on behalf of God and is God’s spokesperson particularly in defense of the voiceless, the marginalized and in favor of faith, morals and justice.  Prophets in the Bible spoke widely and much of their prophetic words revolved broadly on Covenantal fidelity and Justice as against a hypocritical religion, social injustice and behavior.
So the question of proof sounds a little too technical and out of place.  A prophet doesn’t stand in need of an identity card.  He is fearless to speak on issues and this he does through a prayer life rooted in the scriptures, silence, introspection, reflection, discernment through accompaniment.  Much therefore is born out of a contemplative courage.  People in my opinion need not believe on the strength of one’s qualification as much as on the weight of the truth that they are seeking to draw attention.  In paying attention to issues and correcting them we glorify God and work towards building the Kingdom of God which was the Jesus initiative, inaugurated in his day and time.  No prophet needs to trump himself/ herself but the cause of concern.  His or Her life of witness will be the authentic touchstone of what is being spoken of.   
Crucifixion Yes! But not in its barbaric form, but yes the experience of being rejected, ridiculed, mocked, laughed at, imprisoned, and sidelined will be in store.  And all these are the experiences of the Prophets in scripture, Jesus included.  Also true of great prophets in our own day and time.  I’m not giving examples as this is not a session.

Q. Why does logic defy some of the teaching? 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.
I don’t get the very logic of the question itself.  
I am of the opinion that the Teachings of scripture are beautiful and not outdated rather dated for all time in so far as the religious truths are contained. There is great wisdom in the Teaching Tradition of the church. Contrary to what many believe there is sufficient logic in what is taught.  John Paul II wrote Fides et Ratio – Faith and Reason.  I summarize that he says: reason is not against Faith, rather reason is at the service of Faith.
What I do agree is that very few of us reach into the depths of scripture and the teachings of the church.  And those who do are at times not able to convert knowledge into digestible lay language and so it is poorly dressed and does not sound convincing, teasing, challenging and inspiring.  This then runs the risk of being boring, irrelevant. 
Having said the above, in humility and in line with the approach taken by Pope Francis it is true that the Church needs to live its calling in our day and times.  It needs to listen to the concerns of today and share in the search for cumulative solutions. The Church as pointed out is not a Museum where everything is static and we are not called to be Museum Christians. I like the thought of giving a pat on the theology of Pope Francis who is moving forward in reforming, renewing the church at various levels.  His recent “Amoris Laetitia” while holding on to the teachings of the church offers a new and fresh approach that does not discard followers, rather seeks to attend and address their wounds leaving no one outside the circle of God’s love.
There will also be certain areas where logic itself will be relative and perceived differently.  This is not to say one against the other, but diversity and different opinions.  Life is not a math subject where a common formula can be applied.  Yes some questions and fundamental ones will catch us with no sufficient answers.  But then its life and life is a mystery.  Why do we all want to believe that every question ought to have black and white answers…. There’s a shade in between called Grey.  Believing in that shade helps us be less judgmental.

Q. Is coming to church important than worshiping him home? 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.
I believe it is important to come to church.  Christianity is not an individualistic religion and has a strong communitarian dimension.  We are saved as a community.  One must understand there is a huge difference.  
Hindus believe they are saved individually.  They are governed therefore by their Karma which saves or damns them lived out in the dharma of their religion.
Christianity essentially is a communitarian community.  Not that we don’t play our part in living out as true disciples.  Also merely saying, ‘Lord, Lord’ alone is not the password to eternal life. 
Jesus on the night of the Last Supper did not recommend to his chosen 12 to go individually for bed time prayer or private chapels.  He called them TOGETHER as a COMMUNITY gathered around the PASSOVER TABLE which is the TABLE OF THE EUCHARIST for us.   And we gather believing that he urged, “Do this in Memory of Me.” Church is an “ekklesia” a Greek word which is an assembly gathered in God’s name. Please read how the early Christians lived in the Acts of the Apostle.  It was rooted in community living, with prayer, the word of God, koinonia, Eucharist.
If these 12 chosen men chose not to listen to Jesus and opted for private worship in the home, Christianity would not have gone beyond that little geography of Jerusalem.  You and I today would have different names and faith.
Yet again coming to church does not cancel worshipping him alone, or at home.  Each have valid place and space.  I assume that one who understands what it means to be a disciple of Jesus will walk his way.  And His way is one of active service and prayer.  Jesus who called his disciples together at the Last Supper found it necessary also to pray to His Father and give thanks to Him in quiet. 
The first line of the document on liturgy SACROSANCTUM CONCILIUM says, “The Eucharist is the source and summit of Christian life and worship”.  Both are held in unity.
I hope this is a question and not an excuse.

Q. Where does all the cash deposit to the church go? 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.
In the Archdiocese of Bombay we follow the following pattern. The first and second Sunday go towards the work of the Archdiocese and the 3rd 4th and 5th Sundays go towards the up keep and activities of the Parish. The Works of the Archdiocese include the construction of new churches, support of poorer churches, evangelical works, formation of priest, the looking after the sick and retired priest in the clergy home, medical aid to people from any parishes and many other activities that the churches mission and vision compel it to undertake. The balance collection are used for the up keep of the parish, which includes Salaries to the staff, maintenance of the church building and all bills of electricity, property taxes etc. In most case the amount collected by way of the Sunday collection would not be sufficient to cover all expenses.  For example while the 3rd and 4th collection may be in the range of 4 to 5 lakhs, the monthly salaries to all staff numbering about 10 to 12 (2 watchmen, 2 peons, office staff, accountants and others would be about 2 lakhs). The electricity bill for the church and grounds would be between 80,000 to a lakh, the balance amounts would be spent on maintenance of the property, liturgical services and faith formation and church activities. Most of the time this would amount to a negative balance.

Q. Why is the secret library of the Vatican hidden in the archives of the Vatican? A Secret from the world? 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.
The Library is NOT secret. If it were secret you would not know of it!!! It is not opened to every one – since it has documents from the first century… for the sake of preservation temperatures have to be maintained. No sunlight and no flash photographs are permitted.    If you are a scholar and you have a genuine reason to go down to the vaults, you will get permission to do so. By the Way Fr. Warner from our archdiocese has seen them because of his research for the Archdiocese of Bombay Museum. Dan Brown the infamous author who used these facilities to make money and create rumour of the church was also given permission for his first book. Angels and Demons, which ultimately flopped… he then, came out with the Da Vinci Code.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Why only 7 sacraments? Why only the number 7? 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.
The Catechism of the Catholic Church 1210 states: 1210 Christ instituted the sacraments of the new law. There are seven: Baptism, Confirmation (or Chrismation), the Eucharist, Penance, the Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders and Matrimony. The seven sacraments touch all the stages and all the important moments of Christian life: they give birth and increase, healing and mission to the Christian's life of faith. There is thus a certain resemblance between the stages of natural life and the stages of the spiritual life.
The number seven stands for perfection. The Western culture right from the time of the Greek Philosophers believed that there are seven key moments in our lives. 1. Birth [Baptism] 2. Relationships hence [Reconciliation]. 3. Meals [Eucharist] 4. Achieving adult hood – celebrated even in the most backwards parts of world [Confirmation] 5. Being in love and an important part of a stable society [Marriage] Reaching out to others in service – Greeks had special soldiers Spartans [Holy Orders/Priesthood] and the final moments of sickness and death – every culture has rituals [Anointing the sick] 
Christ instituted these seven sacraments so that he could be there with us at these Key-moments of our lives.
Each sacrament must be in the New Testament and instituted by Christ.  Each these seven have a scripture base.

Q. for Wedding Masses a BRIDE MUST WEAR A WHITE LONG GOWN TO IMPLY THE FACT THAT SHE IS PURE, and the GROOM can wear any colour suite ranging from BLACK, BLUE, GREY, BEIGE, BROWN... Isn't the church being SEXIST? 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.
Let’s get this straight. Nowhere in the Bible, the Church documents have ever recommended what to wear for a nuptial (the marriage rite – you can have a wedding without the nuptial rite e.g. a court marriage) 

In the North and South of India, Christians get married in red sarees and the men in any colour trouser, dhoti they can afford. In fact the history of fashion tells us that 176 years ago wearing a red dress was fashionable for a wedding

The idea of wearing white came about in   February 10, 1840, when Queen Victoria wore a lacy white gown with an orange blossom wreath for her wedding to Albert. And since then girls have chosen white, lemon, cream and off white
So the idea of sexist does not come in the picture at all – at least not from the church’s point of view… dress what you like as long as it shows respect for yourself and  respect for those who come to “grace “(pun intended) the ceremony.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Is God present only at the altar or like everywhere and in everyone? Then do we have to bow in front of the altar? 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.
In the Catechism of the Catholic Church we are told that God is Omnipotent [all powerful] Omnipresent [present everywhere] Omniscient [all knowing]
But we also have a church (building) where from the early Church (capital C for the body of Christ) according to the letters of St Paul and early Father of the Church the people congregated to worship and to celebrate the Eucharist. Jesus himself said “wherever two or three are gather I am there in their midst” [Mt.18:20] 
The church is a witness to the presence of Christ in a particular area. For that reason the church at the opening ceremony or rite the church is consecrated (which means holy and set a part for God) with the oil of Chrism. The church altar, the lectern, the church walls also are anointed with the oil of Chrism. That is why it is a sacred space and need to be respected. 
During the Eucharist the priest kisses the altar because a) it is consecrated, b) it represents Jesus who on the cross was the perfect sacrifice being the “altar” the “lamb” and the ‘”priest.” During the Eucharist – which is celebrating the Passion Death and Resurrection of Jesus, we bow before the altar. 
When you are in the Church and there is no Eucharistic service going on, we bow before the Tabernacle – because the “bread of life” the Body of Christ is present in the tabernacle. We believe Jesus IS PRESENT.  Does that require any further explanation when the person is present - do you ignore him?

Q. What's the church's take on homosexuality? 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.
The Church teaches us to love and to love unconditional and it wrong to say that the church teaches otherwise. So what does the Catholic Church teach about same sex attractions and gay marriage? Are homosexuals welcome in the Catholic Church?
Some men and women who struggle with same-sex attractions wonder if there’s any hope for them to be welcomed in or back to the Church. The answer to that question is an unambiguous “yes.”
“The number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not negligible. This inclination constitutes for most of them a trial. They must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. These persons are called to fulfill God’s will in their lives and, if they are Christians, to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord’s Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition.”  (Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2358)

To accept a person means that we love and welcome that person with all their strengths and weaknesses. When we come to know another person’s weaknesses, we should be sensitive to their vulnerabilities and show compassion. Acceptance of another human being does not necessarily mean that we will agree with all his or her decisions and choices.  
 
We have many opportunities to reach out and show love and concern for others.  The more time we spend in prayer and striving to grow in our relationship with Christ, the more the Holy Spirit will fill our hearts with love, understanding, and patience

Q. Aren’t all the laws that the church comes up with are basically to help conserve humanity and society?  So they become obsolete later? 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Why do we respond "and also with your spirit?" How come the priest has a spirit and we don’t? 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.
The Lord be with you is a way of greeting:  We see this in: 
A greeting and a blessing. A blessing -“Both the greeting and the reply are ancient, their origins hid in pre-Christian times. Ruth 2:4 Luke 1:28, cf. Judges 6:12, 2 Chronicles 15:2, 2 Thessalonians 3:16. Et cum spiritu tuo, a formula which betrays its Hebrew origin and has many parallels in 2 Timothy 4:22, cf. Philemon 25; Galatians 6:18; also Philippians 4:23. 
After Vatican II (The council formally opened under Pope John XXIII on 11 October 1962 and closed under Pope Paul VI on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception on 8 December 1965.) The first document that came out and put into effect was the document on Liturgy called Sacrosantum Concilium. This document insisted that we go back to the original liturgy – that meant in the language of the people instead of Latin and where people would participate “participatio actuosa- being the operative word.
When the priest says the Lord be with you: He is blessing you. Surely you have a spirit, and the blessing is bestowing grace to your spirit.  Likewise the priest needs your prayers to bless his spirit, especially when he has a major task at hand: So he needs your blessing when he 1) begins the Mass. Notice how he says it at key moments. 2) When he is about to read and break the Good News. 3) When he is about to begin the prayer of consecration and invites you to give thanks (Eucharist means thanksgiving) The Lord be with you…. Lift up your hearts… 4) when he though unworthy dispenses God’s peace at the sign of Peace and 5) when he needs the courage to tell the congregation the Mass is ended and now go to proclaim God’s word. 
By the way did you notice how Pope Francis when he came on to the balcony for the first time – he asked the people to bless him first before he could bless them… why the spirit moves in numbers, where two or three are gathered….

Q. What is the difference between Catholics and Protestants? 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.
Though there were some minor differences within the Church especially with administration, jurisdiction… which led to the Eastern Churches, etc. The first major “doctrinal’ [belief system] came with Martin Luther was an Augustinian monk. He personally had a scrupulous spiritual life…. He came up with his famous 95 theses against the Catholic Church on October 31, 1517.
The basic first two are that we do not need Confession (something that troubled a great deal) But God wanted us to repent and secondly it is only by Faith we will be saved. Which we believe that it is faith and good works that count. Why did Jesus say “whatever you did to the least of my brothers you did it to me.”
The fall out of this was 1) there is no need of authority to tell us what to do- so no Pope, no hierarchy. 2) No sacraments. Later they would introduce Baptism, 3) Jesus is not present in the Host; it’s only a symbol .But they do have a Eucharistic service. Etc. It is worth reading the remaining 90 odd. One of them which the Catholic Church agreed was on selling indulgences – those who sinned could buy indulgences and their sins are forgiven for life [that is why the church is against Carnival – because that is what was happening during Luther’s time] Luther also attacked the church for High Masses, Low Masses, which after Vatican II are scrapped. He did introduce some good things, but at that time the damage was done.
Immediately after that the King of England getting strength from Luther broke away from the Catholic Church because the Church would not give him a divorce and started his own church ‘The Anglican Church” the King/Queen of England automatically becomes the head of the church.
After that we have many break –aways from the original and so you have Methodist, Baptist, Calvinist and till today minor groups which we call break away groups or born again Churches. So Joyce Meyer has her own Church, Benny Hinn has his own church… etc. 
By the way there is a nice video going around on WhatsApp. “Who started your church?” You will get a gist of all the protestant churches. And because we want to be       united again, we the Catholic Church do not use the word Protestants but “our other brothers and sisters in Christ.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. during Funerals, What is the purpose or importance of burning incense during the burial rite? 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.
Incense has always been used in all religions as a sweet smelling fragrance offer to the Lord.  A form of prayer: 
You find St Paul using it twice – that your life should be a sweet smelling fragrance (2. Cor. 2:15) Phil 4:18, Eph 5:1-2)
The practice is rooted in the earlier traditions of Judaism in the time of the Second Jewish Temple. The smoke of burning incense is interpreted by both the Western Catholic and Eastern Christian churches as a symbol of the prayer of the faithful rising to heaven. ... Incense is often used as part of a purification ritual. 
We also use incense for our respect for Christ –the gifts offered to Jesus at his birth included incense. At Benedictions, we incense the monstrance – Jesus in the Eucharist… At the Eucharist we incense the bishop and the people of God, make them worthy to be a sweet smelling fragrance to God.

Q. Why has religion been the cause for division between people? Why couldn't people just belong to one religion? 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Why is Religion so tough? E.g. Confirmation with so many rules and pressure it makes us want to resent it more 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.
Confirmation is a sacrament that completes the sacraments of initiation. Those who want to receive confirmation must really want to belong to the church. This means they need to be both knowledgeable of the churches teaching and willing to partake in the Churches mission. Thus if one really want to receive confirmation they should be willing to learn about the faith and be willing to witness that faith in the context of daily life. Thus if one is not mature enough to understand the implication that flow from this sacrament then they should not opt for the sacrament of confirmation and once they feel that they truly want to belong and participate in the church and its mission more fully then they should receive the sacrament.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Why is IVF a bad thing in our church? It does give life right? 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.
Why does the Church oppose in vitro fertilization??
The reasons for the Church’s opposition to in vitro fertilization are twofold. First, the Church teaches that human dignity is best respected when the beautiful sexual union of two people conceives a child. This does not happen when a human being is created in a laboratory. As the Catechism teaches: “Techniques involving only the married couple (homologous artificial insemination and fertilization) are perhaps less reprehensible, yet remain morally unacceptable. They dissociate the sexual act from the procreative act. The act which brings the child into existence is no longer an act by which two persons give themselves to one another, but one that entrusts the life and identity of the embryo into the power of doctors and biologists and establishes the domination of technology over the origin and destiny of the human person. Such a relationship of domination is in itself contrary to the dignity and equality that must be common to parents and children. Under the moral aspect procreation is deprived of its proper perfection when it is not willed as the fruit of the conjugal act, that is to say, of the specific act of the spouses’ union . . . Only respect for the link between the meanings of the conjugal act and respect for the unity of the human being make possible procreation in conformity with the dignity of the person.” There is also another reason. Human life begins at conception. This is not just Church teaching, but science supports this claim. Modern genetics has established that a human being’s DNA is created when the sperm fertilizes the egg. At this moment of conception, a unique identity of the human person is created. Unfortunately, in vitro fertilization does not fully respect human life. For the process to be effective, several human embryos are created, and the overwhelming majority is destroyed in the process. It is also worth noting that in vitro fertilization is a process that is relatively ineffective (less than one-fourth of treatments are successful) and causes much physical pain to women. Research also indicates that children conceived in this way are more prone to genetic defects.
So does this mean that the Church essentially teaches that infertile couples cannot share in the great joy that is having children?
Absolutely not! The Catholic Church celebrates human life and the family more than perhaps any other institution in today’s world. The Church recognizes that infertility can be a great cross for couples to carry. The Church is a compassionate and loving mother, and thus she encourages infertile couples to nonetheless try to form a family. In particular, the Church encourages infertile couples to try two options. First, there are millions of all over the world who dream of nothing more than to have parents. It is a great act of Christian charity, and one that brings much joy, to decide to adopt children. This does not mean, however, that the Church is against science in its efforts to help infertile couples. Pope Benedict XVI has said: “The Church pays great attention to the suffering of couples with infertility, she cares for them and, precisely because of this, encourages medical research.” As the Catechism affirms: “Research aimed at reducing human sterility is to be encouraged, on condition that it is placed “at the service of the human person, of his inalienable rights, and his true and integral good according to the design and will of God.” In other words, the Church is not against medical advancements that would help infertile couples as long as they do not interfere with God’s vision of human sexuality and do not disrespect human life. For this reason, the Church is an enthusiastic supporter of NaProTECHNOLOGY. This pioneering method, developed by world-renowned gynecologist Dr. Thomas Hilgers, allows physicians to diagnose the causes of fertility and help couples find a time when they can engage in intercourse with the greatest chance of getting pregnant. In fact, NaProTECHNOLOGY is much more effective than in vitro fertilization, not to say much cheaper and safer. 
Since the Church is against in vitro fertilization, does this mean that the Church sees people conceived this way as somehow worse or evil?
Absolutely not! If a priest tells you this, then he is blatantly going against Church teaching. The Church believes that every human life is a beautiful gift from God, even if that life was not necessarily conceived in accordance with God’s plan. For this reason, the Church celebrates life and is pro-life in the case of every pregnancy, regardless of how it was conceived. When Louise Brown, the first “test tube baby” was born in 1978, Cardinal Albino Luciani, who would become Pope John Paul I a few weeks later, said: “From every side the press is sending its congratulations to the English couple and best wishes to their baby girl. In imitation of God, who desires and loves human life, I too offer my best wishes to the baby girl. As for her parents, I do not have any right to condemn them; subjectively, if they have acted with the right intention and in good faith, they may even obtain great merit before God for what they have decided on and asked the doctors to carry out […] Getting down, however, to the act in itself, and good faith aside, the moral problem which is posed is: is extrauterine fertilization in vitro or in a test tube, licit? […] I do not find any valid reasons to deviate from this norm, by declaring licit the separation of the transmission of life from the marriage act.” The future pope essentially sums up the Church’s position: while she opposes the process of in vitro fertilization, she condemns no one.

Q. If I have to choose between Humanity & Catholic Church which would be more appropriate to choose and why? 
A.
I really don’t understand this question; in my mind there is absolutely no dichotomy in being a true and authentic believer in Christ and his church and being a good human being.

Q. Is Christianity related to science? 
A.
Is Christianity related to science? Yes because Christianity is the Mother of Science or Science is the daughter of Christianity.  All education and pursuits have been born out of Christian initiative and encouragement.  Trace back into history the early scientists and great men are products of Christian universities and studies.  Christianity encourages science, music, arts, even geography for the early missionaries ventured out.
Probably the question I assume is, Is there a conflict between the Bible and Science?  The Bible does not contradict Science.   A reading of the Encyclical “Divinu Afflante Spiritu” and “Dei Verbum” would offer us great help in understand how to read scripture or responding to the question what not to read in the scriptures.  The Bible offers us religious truths which are meant for our salvation and in that it does not err.  Science on the other hand deals with science and not religious truths.  For one to search the other at the cost of the other, worse still denial of the other would be incorrect and do violence.  The Bible cannot be used as a science text book, neither should the science textbook be our library for religious truths and spiritual enhancement.
It is reasonably sensible to believe in what science teaches, for instance in evolution and not be disturbed by the account of creation in the book of Genesis.
Besides this, yes there will be challenges in our ways of understanding reality and the truth.  For instance, when does human life begin?  There will be a difference between what we believe as Christians based on scripture and tradition of the church which shapes our ethical values which will be different from the way science perceives at what point human life begins.  And the Christian viewpoint is not devoid or suffers from poverty of scientific data, knowledge and understanding.

Q. Where does so much money go (collection)? 
A.
In the Archdiocese of Bombay we follow the following pattern. The first and second Sunday go towards the work of the Archdiocese and the 3rd 4th and 5th Sundays go towards the up keep and activities of the Parish. The Works of the Archdiocese include the construction of new churches, support of poorer churches, evangelical works, formation of priest, the looking after the sick and retired priest in the clergy home, medical aid to people from any parishes and many other activities that the churches mission and vision compel it to undertake. The balance collection are used for the up keep of the parish, which includes Salaries to the staff, maintenance of the church building and all bills of electricity, property taxes etc. In most case the amount collected by way of the Sunday collection would not be sufficient to cover all expenses.  For example while the 3rd and 4th collection may be in the range of 4 to 5 lakhs, the monthly salaries to all staff numbering about 10 to 12 (2 watchmen, 2 peons, office staff, accountants and others would be about 2 lakhs). The electricity bill for the church and grounds would be between 80,000 to a lakh, the balance amounts would be spent on maintenance of the property, liturgical services and faith formation and church activities. Most of the time this would amount to a negative balance.
